This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for both Node.js version management and dependency installation.

1. Ensure the expected Node.js version is available via pnpm:

   ```bash
   pnpm env use --global 22.19.0
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
